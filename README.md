# Digit-Recognizer-MNIST-Data

- Used deep learning techniques to train a digit classifier on popular MNIST Data
- Developed a ConvNet with 6 Convolutional Layer and 3 Fully Connected Layer
- Used ReLU, softmax and sigmoid for activation
- Used SGD and Adadelta for optimization
- Achieved an accuracy of 98.2% on test data by using adadelta and sigmoid
- Improved the accuracy to 99.39% by data augmentation
